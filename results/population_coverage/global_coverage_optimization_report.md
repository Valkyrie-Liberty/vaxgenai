## Recommendations

## Implementation Considerations

### Vaccine Development Strategy
1. **Multi-epitope Design**: Include epitopes optimized for global coverage
2. **Platform Selection**: Consider mRNA, viral vector, or peptide platforms based on coverage needs
3. **Adjuvant Strategy**: Select adjuvants that enhance responses across diverse populations
4. **Manufacturing**: Plan for global distribution and cold chain requirements

### Clinical Development
1. **Phase I/II Trials**: Include diverse populations in early trials
2. **Immunogenicity Assessment**: Monitor responses across different HLA backgrounds
3. **Efficacy Endpoints**: Design endpoints that capture population-specific responses
4. **Regulatory Strategy**: Engage with global regulatory authorities early

### Access and Equity
1. **Pricing Strategy**: Consider tiered pricing for different economic regions
2. **Distribution**: Prioritize vulnerable populations and high-burden areas
3. **Local Partnerships**: Collaborate with local healthcare systems
4. **Technology Transfer**: Consider local manufacturing capabilities
