# Conformational B-cell Epitope Prediction Report - SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein

## Summary

Protein sequence length: 943 amino acids
Total conformational epitopes predicted: 0
## Recommendations

Limited conformational B-cell epitopes identified. Consider:
- Analyzing different protein domains
- Lowering prediction thresholds
- Examining linear epitopes as alternatives

**Experimental Validation Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize epitopes with scores > 0.7 for initial testing
2. Use ELISA or surface plasmon resonance for binding assays
3. Test with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
4. Consider peptide cyclization for conformational epitopes
5. Validate structural predictions with experimental structures

**Vaccine Design Considerations:**
1. Conformational epitopes may require native protein structure
2. Consider protein subunit vaccines or virus-like particles
3. Evaluate epitope accessibility in native protein context
4. Test epitope stability under vaccine storage conditions
5. Consider adjuvants that preserve protein conformation
