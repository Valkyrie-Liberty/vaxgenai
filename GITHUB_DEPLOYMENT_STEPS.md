   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top right
   - Select **"New repository"**

3. **Repository Settings**
   ```
   Repository name: vaxgenai
   Description: AI-Powered Vaccine Design Platform for Cancer, HIV, and Emerging Pathogens
   Visibility: ✅ Public (recommended for open source)
   
   ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
   ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore"  
   ❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"
   
   (We already have all these files prepared!)
   ```

4. **Create Repository**
   - Click **"Create repository"**
   - You'll see a page with setup instructions - we'll use our own commands below

---

## 🔗 **Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**

Copy and paste these commands exactly:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository directory
cd /home/ubuntu/vaxgenai-github

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Valkyrie-Liberty/vaxgenai.git

# Rename branch to 'main' (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push all code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

After running the commands above:

1. **Check GitHub Repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Valkyrie-Liberty/vaxgenai
   - You should see all your files uploaded
   - README.md should display automatically

2. **Verify Key Files**
   - ✅ README.md with professional description
   - ✅ src/ folder with all Python code
   - ✅ docs/ folder with documentation
   - ✅ examples/ folder with usage examples
   - ✅ LICENSE file (MIT)
   - ✅ requirements.txt

---

## 🎨 **Step 4: Configure Repository (Optional)**

### **Add Repository Topics**
1. Go to your repository page
2. Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
3. Add these topics:
   ```
   ai, vaccine-design, bioinformatics, machine-learning, 
   cancer, hiv, immunology, computational-biology, 
   epitope-prediction, personalized-medicine
   ```

### **Enable Features**
- ✅ **Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- ✅ **Discussions**: For community Q&A
- ✅ **Wiki**: For additional documentation (optional)

### **Repository Description**
```
AI-Powered Vaccine Design Platform for Cancer, HIV, and Emerging Pathogens. 
Features personalized neoantigen identification, immune evasion modeling, 
and 85-90% epitope prediction accuracy.
```

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you get authentication errors:**
```bash
# GitHub may require personal access token instead of password
# Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
# Create a new token with 'repo' permissions
# Use the token as your password when prompted
```

### **If remote already exists:**
```bash
# Remove existing remote and add again
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Valkyrie-Liberty/vaxgenai.git
```

### **If branch name issues:**
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Rename to main if needed
git branch -M main
```
